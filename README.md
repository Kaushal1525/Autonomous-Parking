🚗 Autonomous Vehicle Simulation
📌 About
This project simulates an Autonomous Vehicle using Pygame and OpenCV. The car detects lanes, follows the center of the road, and avoids obstacles dynamically. The simulation integrates basic lane detection and autonomous control to adjust the car’s movement.

🎮 Features
✅ Lane Detection using OpenCV
✅ Autonomous Navigation with real-time lane following
✅ Obstacle Avoidance to prevent collisions
✅ Smooth Car Movement & Rotation using trigonometry
✅ Interactive Pygame Visualization

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pygame (for rendering simulation)
OpenCV (for lane detection)
NumPy & Math (for calculations)
📊 How It Works
🔹 The car follows the lane center using OpenCV-detected road lanes
🔹 The vehicle adjusts direction based on lane position
🔹 Obstacle detection & avoidance prevents collisions
🔹 The car moves autonomously, aligning with the detected lanes# Autonomous-Parking
